NickServ
--------
If server supports SASL, you should use that instead of sending command for nickserv authentication, for example:

    /set irc.server_default.sasl_mechanism dh-blowfish
    /set irc.server.freenode.sasl_username "mynick"
    /set irc.server.freenode.sasl_password "xxxxxxx"

To run a command after connection to server, for example to authenticate with nickserv (only if you donâ€™t use SASL for authentication):

    /set irc.server.freenode.command "/msg nickserv identify xxxxxxx"

If server does not support SASL, you can add a delay (between command and join of channels):

    /set irc.server.freenode.command_delay 5
